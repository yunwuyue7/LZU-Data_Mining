Classification & Clustering

to Week 13: Classification
1. Classify data (dim = [60218, 335]) to groups on samplegroup:ch1, 
2. Regression models on GSM to das28.ch1 e.g. Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Quantile Regression, or others

to Week 18: Clustering
1. Clustering  (dim = [60218, 335]) to groups w.r.t. samplegroup:ch1
2. Clustering to groups w.r.t. das28.ch1 for three groups of low: [0,1), middle: [1, 3), and high: [3, inf]
